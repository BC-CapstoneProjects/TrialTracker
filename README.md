The goal of Kinisi is simple: to allow anybody and everybody a privacy focused alternative to other activity trackers currently on the market. Kinisi aims to be low bloat, open source, free range and organic, all while providing advanced analytics on different sports and outdoor activities.

### Features

* **Tracking:** Track and record your activies
* **Analytics:** View statistics on your activities
* **Trail search:** Find new hikes in your area
* **Wearable integration:**  We plan to be compatable with Gadgetbridge, an Android (4.4+) application which will allow you to use your Pebble, Mi Band, Amazfit Bip and HPlus device (and more) without the vendor's closed source application and without the need to create an account and transmit any of your data to the vendor's servers.
